Leetcode 3462: Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-with-at-most-k-elements)

You are given a 2D integer matrix grid of size n x m, an integer array limits of length n, and an integer k. 
The task is to find the maximum sum of at most k elements from the matrix grid such that:
The number of elements taken from the ith row of grid does not exceed limits[i].
Return the maximum sum.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]], limits = [1,2], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation:
From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are 4 and 3.
The maximum possible sum of at most 2 selected elements is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[5,3,7],[8,2,6]], limits = [2,2], k = 3
Output: 21
Explanation:
From the first row, we can take at most 2 elements. The element taken is 7.
From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are 8 and 6.
The maximum possible sum of at most 3 selected elements is 7 + 8 + 6 = 21.
 
Constraints:
n == grid.length == limits.length
m == grid[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 500
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
0 <= limits[i] <= m
0 <= k <= min(n * m, sum(limits))

Approach:
1. Use a Max Heap (Priority Queue) to extract the largest elements quickly.
2. Push all elements from the matrix into the heap, storing them as negative values (since Pythonâ€™s heapq is a min-heap by default).
3. Extract elements from the heap while respecting limits:
   a. Check if the row's limit allows selection before adding to the sum.
   b. Decrement k after each valid selection.
4. Return the total sum.
